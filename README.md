# Kalotyp

> An open-source image editor for Ghost.
> *From Greek* kalos *(beautiful) +* typos *(impression). Pronounced* /kaˈloʊ.tɪp/

Kalotyp is a focused, MIT-licensed image editor that drops into Ghost CMS.
Self-hosted Ghost users can install it through **Settings → Integrations → Pintura** by uploading the Kalotyp JS and CSS files — no changes to Ghost itself.

## Install

In Ghost admin, go to **Settings → Integrations → Pintura** and toggle the
integration on. You can either **upload** the two build files, or **point Ghost
at a CDN URL** — Ghost stores whatever URL you give it.

> "Pintura" here is the name of Ghost's built-in image-editor integration slot,
> not a reference to any particular editor. Kalotyp is an independent project and
> is not affiliated with or endorsed by that editor; it simply implements the
> integration interface Ghost exposes under this name.

### Option A — CDN (no download)

Paste these into the JS URL and CSS URL fields. Every published release is served
automatically from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), a free, GDPR-compliant,
multi-CDN that doesn't log personal data:

```
JS:  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@magicpages/kalotyp/dist/kalotyp.js
CSS: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@magicpages/kalotyp/dist/kalotyp.css
```

These always serve the latest published release. Pin an exact version (e.g.
`@magicpages/kalotyp@0.1.1/dist/kalotyp.js`) if you'd rather upgrade deliberately.
The same files are mirrored on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) at
`https://unpkg.com/@magicpages/kalotyp/dist/kalotyp.js` if you prefer.

### Option B — Upload the files

Download `kalotyp.js` and `kalotyp.css` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/magicpages/kalotyp/releases/latest) (or build
them locally with `pnpm build`) and upload both in the integration settings.
That's the entire setup — no changes to Ghost itself.

### Fonts & privacy

The text annotation tool offers the same web fonts Ghost's own admin uses,
loaded at runtime from [fonts.bunny.net](https://fonts.bunny.net) — a
GDPR-friendly, privacy-focused font CDN. No font bytes are bundled, and nothing
is sent to Magic Pages. If the CDN is unreachable (offline, strict CSP, or
air-gapped install), the editor falls back to the system font and keeps working;
saved images bake with whatever font is available. To allow the fonts under a
content-security policy, permit `fonts.bunny.net` in `style-src`/`font-src`.
